# Phase 6D Findings Report

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Current Test Score:** 70/200 (+3 improvement from 67)
**Status:** Scanner complete, grammar wiring requires careful design

## Completed Work

### Scanner Implementation ✅
- Added NEWLINE and BLANK_LINE token types to enum
- Extended Scanner struct with `in_fenced_code` and `in_indented_code` flags
- Implemented bitfield serialization (3 bools → 1 byte)
- Added helper functions: `is_newline()`, `is_space_char()`, `is_inline_expression_start()`
- **NEWLINE Token:** Full CRLF support (handles both `\r\n` and `\n`)
- **BLANK_LINE:** Infrastructure in place, disabled pending grammar design
- Commit: `ccd570b`

## Key Findings

### Grammar Wiring Complexity

**Issue:** Cannot simply replace `/\n/` with `$._NEWLINE` in paragraph rules.

**Why:**
- `$._NEWLINE` is an external token only emitted when `valid_symbols[NEWLINE]` is true
- External tokens have different parsing semantics than regex patterns
- Replacing regex `/\n/` with external token requires complete grammar restructuring
- Simple replacement breaks paragraph parsing (tested: 70 → 29 passing tests)

**Solution:** Gradual grammar redesign needed:
1. Separate newline handling from line continuation in paragraphs
2. Use external tokens strategically, not as drop-in replacements
3. Implement proper state machine coordination between scanner and grammar
4. Test each change incrementally to avoid regressions

### BLANK_LINE Implementation Status

**Infrastructure:** ✅ Complete
- Token type defined
- Scanning logic written (currently disabled)
- Grammar externals updated

**Pending:** Grammar wiring
- Need rules that explicitly reference `$._BLANK_LINE`
- Must handle both single newlines (paragraph continuation) and blank lines (block separation)
- Lists require blank line handling for proper nesting

### Test Categories Breakdown

**Passing (70/200):**
- Document & Frontmatter: ✓
- Headings: ✓
- Code blocks: ✓
- Markdoc tags (basic): ✓
- Inline expressions (simple): ✓
- Frontmatter: ✓

**Failing (36/106):**
- Multi-line paragraphs (12, 13) - Need NEWLINE/BLANK_LINE coordination
- Lists (50-59) - Need blank line separator recognition
- HTML handling (44-49) - Grammar issue
- Complex expressions (39, 42) - May benefit from conflict fixes
- Markdown comments (46-49) - Not implemented

## Recommendations for Phase 6E

### Option A: Incremental Grammar Refactoring (Recommended)
1. Create new paragraph rule variant that handles `$._NEWLINE` explicitly
2. Keep old regex-based rules as fallback
3. Gradually migrate rules to use external tokens
4. Test after each migration
5. **Estimated:** 4-6 hours, likely 75-85/200 tests

### Option B: Focus on High-Value Targets
1. Fix list parsing (handle blank line separation)
2. Improve HTML handling
3. Add support for markdown comments
4. **Estimated:** 2-3 hours, likely 75-78/200 tests

### Option C: Complete Scanner Activation
1. Enable BLANK_LINE scanning with proper lookahead
2. Wire both NEWLINE and BLANK_LINE into document structure rules
3. Refactor source_file rule to use BLANK_LINE for block separation
4. **Estimated:** 6-8 hours, likely 80-90/200 tests

## Technical Debt

- State flags (`in_fenced_code`, `in_indented_code`) are declared but not actively toggled
- BLANK_LINE scanning disabled to prevent regressions
- No state machine callbacks from grammar to scanner
- Missing coordination between scanner state and grammar rules

## Next Steps

1. Design proper state machine interface between grammar and scanner
2. Implement gradual migration of grammar rules to external tokens
3. Add comprehensive test coverage for edge cases (CRLF, nesting, etc.)
4. Document scanner/grammar coordination patterns for future phases
