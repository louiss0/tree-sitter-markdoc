# Option B: Quick Wins Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Baseline**: 66/100 tests passing  
**Current**: 67/100 tests passing (+1)  
**Time Invested**: ~1 hour

## Completed Improvements

### ✅ Test 48: Markdoc Comment Block Support
**Change**: Added `comment_block` rule to grammar  
**Syntax**: `{% comment %}...{% /comment %}`  
**Implementation**:
- Created dedicated rule with high-precedence tokenized delimiters
- Placed before `markdoc_tag` in `_block` choice to prevent conflict
- Content matched with `repeat(choice(/[^{\n]+/, /\n/, /\{/))`
- Commit: `b81e416`

## Analysis of Remaining Failures (33 tests)

### Blocked by External Scanner Issues (26 tests)
**Cannot fix without Phase 2 scanner:**
- Tests 12, 13, 98: Multi-line paragraphs
- Tests 38, 39, 42, 58-59, 88-89, 94-97: Inline expressions with member/call access
- Tests 50-57, 72, 84-85, 99: List parsing and indentation

### Potentially Fixable (7 tests)
**Could attempt but high complexity:**

1. **Tests 44, 45, 49: HTML Block Structure** (3 tests)
   - Current: HTML parsed as monolithic token
   - Need: `html_attr` and `html_content` nodes
   - Complexity: High - requires restructuring HTML tokenization
   - Estimate: 2-3 hours, uncertain success
   - Risk: May break currently passing HTML tests

2. **Tests 60-62: Binary/Unary Expressions** (3 tests) 
   - Need: `binary_expression`, `unary_expression` nodes
   - Complexity: Medium-High - operator precedence conflicts
   - Previous attempts in Phase 4 had limited success
   - Estimate: 2-3 hours
   - Risk: Grammar conflicts, potential regressions

3. **Test 87: Indented Code Block in Tag** (1 test)
   - Might be solvable if it's just a precedence issue
   - Estimate: 30 minutes
   - Risk: Low

## Realistic Option B Ceiling

**Maximum achievable without Phase 2**: ~70-72/100 tests
- Current: 67/100
- Remaining "easy" wins: 3-5 tests maximum
- Fundamental issues (26 tests) require external scanner

## Recommendations

### Continue Option B (Limited Scope)
**If time permits (1-2 more hours):**
1. Attempt Test 87 (indented code in tag) - lowest risk
2. Skip HTML and operator fixes - too complex for diminishing returns

### Proceed to Phase 2 (Recommended)
**For substantial progress (80+ tests):**
1. Implement proper external scanner with:
   - `_NEWLINE` vs `_BLANK_LINE` distinction
   - Fix `_code_content` to not interfere with expressions
   - Add indentation tracking
2. This solves 26 of remaining 33 failures
3. Estimated: 4-6 hours
4. Gets to 90-95/100 tests

## Current State Summary

### What Works Well (67 tests)
- ✅ Frontmatter and headings
- ✅ Code fences (with external scanner)
- ✅ Simple Markdoc tags and attributes
- ✅ HTML comments and simple blocks
- ✅ Inline formatting (emphasis, strong, code, links, images)
- ✅ Basic expressions (identifiers, strings, numbers, arrays, objects)
- ✅ Comment blocks (NEW!)

### What's Blocked (33 tests)
- ❌ Multi-line paragraphs (scanner needed)
- ❌ Complex inline expressions (scanner conflict)
- ❌ List indentation (scanner needed)
- ❌ HTML structural parsing (high complexity)
- ❌ Binary/unary operators (conflicts)

## Files Modified
- `grammar.js`: Added `comment_block` rule
- `src/parser.c`, `src/grammar.json`, `src/node-types.json`: Regenerated

## Next Session Recommendation

**Start Phase 2 External Scanner Implementation:**
1. Read Phase 2 specification in TECHNICAL_SPEC_28_TESTS.md
2. Modify existing `src/scanner.c` to add proper token handling
3. Update `grammar.js` externals to include new tokens
4. Test incrementally as tokens are added

This is the only path to 80+ tests passing.
