# Phase 7: Scanner Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented a context-aware external scanner that enables multi-line paragraph parsing in the tree-sitter-markdoc parser.

## Achievement

**Test Results:**
- **Before:** 36 failing tests (out of 106 total)
- **After:** 34 failing tests
- **Fixed:** Tests #12 "Paragraph with multiple lines" and #13 "Two paragraphs separated by blank line"

## Implementation Details

### Scanner Logic (`src/scanner.c`)

The scanner now implements context-aware newline handling:

1. **Newline Classification:**
   - Counts consecutive newlines
   - Looks ahead past whitespace to determine context
   - Checks if next non-whitespace character is a block marker

2. **Token Emission:**
   - `_BLANK_LINE`: Emitted for:
     - 2+ consecutive newlines (true blank lines)
     - Single newline followed by block marker (block boundary)
   - `_NEWLINE`: Emitted for:
     - Single newline NOT followed by block marker (line continuation)
   - Returns `false` at EOF to let grammar's `repeat(/\n/)` handle trailing newlines

3. **Block Markers Detected:**
   - `#` (headings)
   - `-`, `*`, `+` (lists/thematic breaks)
   - `_` (thematic breaks)
   - `>` (blockquotes)
   - `` ` ``, `~` (code fences)
   - `<` (HTML)
   - `{` (Markdoc tags/expressions)
   - `0-9` (ordered lists)

### Grammar Changes (`grammar.js`)

1. **source_file:** Uses `choice($_BLANK_LINE, /\n/)` for block separation
   - Scanner provides `_BLANK_LINE` when appropriate
   - Falls back to `/\n/` for cases scanner doesn't handle

2. **paragraph:** Uses `$._NEWLINE` for line continuation
   - Scanner only emits this when NOT at a block boundary
   - Enables multi-line paragraphs

## Test Cases Verified

✅ **Multi-line paragraph:**
```markdown
Line one
Line two
Line three
```
Produces: ONE paragraph with THREE text nodes

✅ **Heading followed by paragraph:**
```markdown
# Heading
Paragraph text
```
Produces: heading + paragraph (two separate blocks)

✅ **Two paragraphs with blank line:**
```markdown
First paragraph

Second paragraph
```
Produces: TWO separate paragraphs

## Remaining Failures (34 tests)

The remaining failures fall into categories identified in TECHNICAL_SPEC_28_TESTS.md:

1. **Lists** (14 tests): Need indentation tracking and list_paragraph nodes
2. **HTML** (6 tests): Need HTML block restructuring
3. **Expressions** (5 tests): Need binary/unary operator support
4. **Edge cases** (9 tests): Various specialized scenarios

## Key Technical Insights

1. **EOF Handling:** Scanner must return `false` at EOF rather than emitting tokens, to avoid consuming trailing newlines that the grammar expects to handle.

2. **Token Priority:** Grammar uses `choice()` to prefer scanner tokens but fall back to raw patterns when scanner returns false.

3. **Lookahead Strategy:** Scanner advances past whitespace for lookahead but marks token end BEFORE lookahead, ensuring proper backtracking.

4. **Context Awareness:** The scanner's ability to check for block markers enables the "impossible" distinction between line continuation and block separation mentioned in the technical spec.

## Next Steps (Future Work)

Per TECHNICAL_SPEC_28_TESTS.md Phase 1.5 (Pragmatic Approach):

1. **Binary/Unary Operators** (10 tests) - Add expression hierarchy
2. **List Paragraphs** (5 tests) - Create `list_paragraph` rule
3. **HTML Block Structure** (3 tests) - Parse HTML into structured nodes

These changes don't require complex scanner work and can be done with grammar modifications alone.

## Conclusion

Phase 7 successfully implemented the core scanner functionality needed for multi-line paragraph support. The scanner now provides context-aware newline handling that distinguishes between line continuation and block boundaries, solving the "mathematically impossible" problem mentioned in the technical spec through lookahead analysis.
